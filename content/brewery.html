		     <span class="all-caps">The Brew Gentlemen Beer Company</span> is located in a small steel town just east of Pittsburgh. Located on the Monongahela River, Braddock was once a booming business center and the heart of Andrew Carnegie's steel empire. Nowadays, as its website proclaims, "Braddock presents an unparalleled opportunity for the urban pioneer, artist, or misfit to join in building a new kind of community". We hope you will visit the brewery for a sampling of our beer menu and a tour of the facility.

		    <strong>Our taproom and lounge are open 4 PM - 10 PM on Wednesday/Thursday and 4 PM - 11 PM on Friday/Saturday.</strong>
