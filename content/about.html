		     From left to right, Asa Foster and Matt Katase are the co-founders of <span class="all-caps">The Brew Gentlemen Beer Company</span>. They started the brewery in a garage in early 2011. Alonzo Benavides began building technology as CTO and webmaster in late 2012. Zach Barbieri works the taproom in Braddock and he has been part of the team since the beginning. Brandon Capps stepped in as head brewer in early 2014, bringing experience and new recipes. Behind the scenes, Pete Kurzweg represents the legal counsel and keeps the paperwork at bay. Not featured above, are the many Kickstarter contributers, personal investors, and community members who have helped make the brewery a reality.

		     <span class="about-goal">Our goals are to create an ambitious variety of high-quality beers, operate a comfortable taproom and lounge in which to serve them, and to be a part of the ongoing reinvention of Braddock.</span>
